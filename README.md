## Introduction
This repository contains the toy code to reproduce the NQM results from the paper Which Alorithmic Choices Matter at Which Batch Sizes?[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04164.pdf).

Particularly, you can reproduce our results on momentum, preconditioning, exponential moving average and learning rate decay with this code. Here are a few figures from our paper.
